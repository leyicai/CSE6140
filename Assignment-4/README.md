Description
-------------
This program is used to compute the max subarray of given input data. The input data from a file is formed as an array with n rows and k columns. Each row is an array with k elements. The program gives the result of each row with two different algorithms, and writes the output into two output files.

Installation
------------

To install the first program, simply run

    g++ main.cc function.cc -std=c++11 -o A4


Execution
-----------

Assuming the your executable is called "A4", run it using

    ./A4 <input_file>
Note: <input_file> is the name of the input, which should be formed like "10.txt", where "10" indicates the rows of the data.
